## Goal 

Help improve in-class, realtime, face-to-face discussion.

Primarily:
1. students engage with each other's positions/contributions
    1. avoiding acontextual disjoint contributions
2. increase the diversity of positions expressed
    1. in-class and f2f, there's risk to expressing your actual personally held position


Hypothesis: because of anonymity, students might feel less risk/vulnerable in sharing actual position, because of swap, we all know from the outset in the f2f small group conversation that no one is speaking from their own "thought"

### Challenges

1. all the interesting interaction happens in people space (outside of the system)
    1. so the system itself can't collect the data we actually care about
    2. TS didn't know what the small groups were
        1. we can fix this
        2. we also couldn't measure/manipulate the diversity of positions in the small group
    3. TS had no AI
        1. TS doesn't know approximately how many positions are represented in the responses to the prompts
            1. so we couldn't measure or manipulate 
        2. 

## Notes

1. Stewart not run code yet
2. making progress on hosting
3. Vic and Donovan have been working on containerizing
4. Vic worked up typescript version
    1. currently
        1. re users
            1. login through canvas (so we know they're not randos)
                1. prof can see everything, but we have to change that so that they can't see
                    1. vic's concern: what if person says something problematic (this isn't strictly our problem)
                        1. already they can delete one
                        2. maybe if we're confident in some kind of ai, we can have a small moderation queue that the prof (or TAs or whoever) must approve before they're distributed/displayed, etc
                2. room code
                    1. isn't necessary usually because the students are already confirmed (perhaps with initial join code) to be in the prof's course
                    2. use for creating roster
                    3. use for demo mode
        2. re question experience
            1. multiple choice, scaling, else
            2. after the thoughts are swapped
        3. session
            1. currently the room code defines the session (this should change)
            2. setting for number of "reswap" for student to request a different thought
5. Mayfield and many of us want an in-house more customizable kahoot? socrativ?
    1. Peer Instruction
6. Session
    1. length

### Group Management

1. How can we work for courses and clubs or groups and demos
    1. how to know membership and roles
        1. e.g. edstem, piazza, etc.
            1. prof make class (official makes group)
                1. constituents join with code and default to participant role in class/group
                2. prof/official can offer a different join code or can go in the roster to promote users to other roles?

### Prior Work

1. https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C47&q=thoughtswap&btnG= 
2. currently in node with websockets
    1. buggy
    2. lacks testing
    3. data model is not optimized for analysis
    4. profs can't prepare prompts in advance
3. Anonymity
    1. prof create class
        1. the system creates N pseudonymns 
    2. prof would assign to each student in their class a login (pseudonym from above)
    3. system never shows prof or students pseudonym stuff 
4. prof screen 
    1. manual drag/drop reordering
    2. never got to implement manual grouping (not sure if it's interesting any more)

## Action Items

1. Vic: talk about multiple choice 
2. User registration/login respecting Anonymity
3. Stewart: email everyone with Shrestha - MVP canvas only login: onboarding info that explains that prof can't see who they are in connection with their contribution 
4. profs
    1. see the name to confirm registration/roster/course membership
    2. don't show prof the names of students generally
        1. potentially if X% of the students in the course participate, prof gets boolean list of names who participated today?
5. don't boot anything automatically
6. student can enter multiple join codes, these do not activate session, these put them in the corresponding course roster (unless later denied by prof)
    1. when student logs in they can enter yet another join code, or they click the course they've previously joined
    2. when they click the course:
        1. drop into the active session if there is one
        2. if there's no active session, can they see anything?
            1. e.g. they could see the past sessions
                1. with the prompts
                    1. with their own thoughts
                    2. with the thoughts they were assigned/distributed?
7. students: get stewart a list of API scopes for the canvas key
8. stewart:
    1. get the server and hostname to the students
        1. FYi we currently "own" thoughtswap.org and thought-swap.org
9. students: Prof presenter screen
    1.  that shows all the thoughts show in a different window? 
        1.  the student either during author/discussion or at least in retro, can see all the thoughts?
            1.  if they see it during session, the student could click to highlight/maximize or ?? the thought they're trying to refer to in wholegroup conversation
10. students: offering groupings screen for prof to show (or students to see in the app themselves?)
11.
