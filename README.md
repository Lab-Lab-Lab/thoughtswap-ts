# ThoughtSwap

ThoughtSwap is a real-time classroom discussion tool that facilitates anonymous peer review of short answers ("thoughts") using Canvas for authentication.

- **Client**: React (Vite) + Tailwind CSS
- **Server**: Node.js (Express) + Socket.io + Prisma (PostgreSQL)

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18+ recommended)
- **npm**
- **Docker & Docker Compose**
- A **Canvas LMS** instance (or a Free-for-Teacher account) for developer keys.

## 🚀 Docker Quickstart

The easiest way to build and deploy ThoughtSwap locally is using Docker Compose. This spins up the Postgres database, API server, and Client UI automatically.

1.  **Configure Environment:**
    Copy the example environment file to `.env`:

    ```bash
    cp env.example .env
    ```

    Open `.env` and populate the **Canvas Configuration** section (Client ID, Secret, URL). You can generally leave the Database and Port configurations at their defaults.

2.  **Start the Application:**
    1. If running a demo (where you want others to connect and try out the app running on your computer)
        1. start ngrok first:
            ```
            ngrok 5173
            ```
        2. get the ngrok URL from the `Forwarding` output, e.g. `https://9ca1-128-130-184-40.ngrok-free.app`
        3. update [vite.config.js](./packages/client/vite.config.ts) to add the ngrok hostname to the `allowedhosts`
    2. Run the following command to build the images and start the services:

        ```bash
        docker-compose up --build
        ```

        _Note: The server container will automatically apply database migrations upon startup._

3.  **Access:**
    - **Client:** [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
    - **Server:** [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

4.  **Optional: Seed Data**
    To create the "Dev Teacher" account without a real Canvas login, run the seed command inside the running server container:

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec server npx prisma db seed
    ```
5. Troubleshooting:
    1. Blocked request
        1. after adding the ngrok host to vite config (see above), you have to rebuild at least the frontend docker container, so maybe just kill the docker container and re-run
            ```bash
            docker-compose up --build
            ```

## 🛠️ Manual Setup & Development

If you prefer to run the Node applications directly on your host machine (while using Docker for the database), follow these steps.

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/victor-hugo-dc/thoughtswap-ts.git
    cd thoughtswap-ts
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This will install dependencies for the root, client, and server workspaces.

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Environment Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory (or `packages/server/.env` depending on your preference, but the docker setup expects it at root or server level).

    ```env
    # Server Configuration
    PORT=8000
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/thoughtswap?schema=public"
    FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173"

    # Canvas OAuth Configuration
    # Obtain these from Canvas Admin -> Developer Keys
    CANVAS_CLIENT_ID="your_client_id"
    CANVAS_CLIENT_SECRET="your_client_secret"
    CANVAS_BASE_URL="https://<your-canvas-instance>.instructure.com"

    # IMPORTANT: Must match exactly what is configured in Canvas
    CANVAS_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:8000/accounts/canvas/login/callback/"
    ```

### 4. Start the Database

Use Docker to spin up the PostgreSQL database defined in `docker-compose.yml`.

```bash
docker-compose up -d postgres
```

### 5. Run Migrations & Seed

Apply the Prisma schema to your database and seed the initial dev user.

```bash
# Run from the root
npm run dev --workspace=packages/server
# OR specifically for migrations:
cd packages/server
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma db seed
```

The seed command creates a "Dev Teacher" account (teacher@dev.com) which allows you to test teacher features without a real Canvas login.

### 6. Start the Application

Run both the client and server concurrently from the root directory.

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Client: http://localhost:5173
- Server: http://localhost:8000
